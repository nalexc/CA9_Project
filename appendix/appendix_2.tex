\chapter{Linearisation of the relative dynamics eqations} \label{chap:C}
From the equations(ref B8) and assuming that the radius is constant and the angular velocity is equals to $w = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{R^3}}$, a linearisation of the system can be derived using some apporximations. the state is defined as :
\begin{flalign*}
s = [x; \dot{x}; y; \dot{y}]
\end{flalign*}
Moreover, the norm of the velocity of both satellite is assumed to be equal and to be constant ($||\vec{\dot{p_1}}|| = ||\vec{\dot{p_2}}|| = C$). Therefore, the nominal system is given by:
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
	& \dot{s_1} = s_2 \\
	& \dot{s_2} = 2ws_4 - u_2\frac{y^{*}wC}{m} \\
	& \dot{s_3} = s_4 \\
	& \dot{s_4} = -2ws_2 - (u_2 - u_1)\frac{wRC}{m}
	\label{eq:statespaceassumption}  
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}
using the approximation $\dot{x}$, $y << y^{*}$ and $x, x^{*}$, $\frac{\dot{y}}{w} << R$.
