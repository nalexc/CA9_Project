This report describes the design and simulation of a control system on a AAU-CubeSat, which is a pico- satellite used for Low Earth Orbit flight.

The objective is to use a flight formation for monitoring Greenland, by having eight satellites equally distributed in orbit.

Two controllers must be designed, one to control the angle between the satellites using the drag force, and one for attitude control.  The drag force applied on the satellite depends on the cross section area which can be controlled using the orientation of the satellite.

A linear and a non-linear control method have been designed in order to compare the differences between them.
