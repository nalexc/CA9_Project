This report describes the design and implementation of a control system on an AAU-CubeSat, a pico- satellite used for Low Earth Orbit flight.

The objective is to use a flight formation for monitoring Greenland, by having six satellites equally distributed on orbit.

Two controllers must be design, one for controlling the distance between the satellites using the drag force, and one for attitude control.

Given the nonlinear nature of the system a SMC is implemented.
