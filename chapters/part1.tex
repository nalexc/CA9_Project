\chapter{Angle control between satellites}
In this chapter, the focus will be on modelling and the control of the angle between two satellites using the drag force as the control input of the system. The satellite is assumed to be able to change its orientation instantaneously, therefore the drag force can be modified instantaneously. The Earth and the satellite are assumed to be a point mass to simplify the system. 
\section{Modelling}
The satellite is mainly subjected to three forces: the gravity, the drag force and the solar radiation. Thus, the second law of Newton gives:
\begin{flalign}
 \sum \vec {F} = m_{sat} \ \vec a = \vec{F_g} + \vec{F_D} + \vec{F_{rad}}
	\label{eq:ecc}
\end{flalign}
with the gravity modeled by:
\begin{flalign}
{\vec F_g} = -G\frac{m_{earth} m_{sat}}{||\vec{p}||^3} \vec{p}
	\label{eq:eccc}
\end{flalign}
where $\vec{p}$ is the vector position of the satellite from the Earth centre to the mass centre of the satellite in the inertial frame and the expression for ${\vec F_D}$ and ${\vec F_{rad}}$ are explained in the next section.
\subsection{Modelling of the control input: Aerodynamic Drag Force}
The satellite is subjected to an aerodynamic drag force due to the atmosphere. The collisions with the air cause a force in the opposite direction of the velocity of the satellite. The force was modelled by Lord Rayleigh.\cite{FSA}
\begin{flalign}
	\vec{F_D} = -\frac{1}{2} \rho \ C_D \ A_{\perp} ||\vec{v}||  \vec{v}
	\label{eq:ec1c}
\end{flalign}
where $\rho$ is the density of the air, $C_D$ is the drag coefficient, $A_{\perp}$ is the area that is perpendicular in the direction of the velocity of the satellite $\vec{v}$. 

The drag coefficient $C_D$ and the perpendicular area $A_{\perp}$ depend on the orientation of the satellite. Therefore, this force can be used as an input for the control of the position and the velocity of the satellite.

The density of the air depends on the altitude of the satellite and the air temperature, but it is considered to be constant in this case for simplifying the model. $\rho$ is chosen to be equal to $1.454 \cdot 10^{-13} Kg/{m^3}$ based on the  empirical model of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) International Reference Atmosphere \cite{FSA}.

The drag coefficient is dependent on the orientation and the maximum value of $C_D$ is equal to 1.05 for a non tilted cubed as shown on \figref{fig:drag} and equal to 0.80 for an angled cubed \cite{wik}. The drag coefficient is assumed to be constant and equal to 1 in order to simplify the equation. 
\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\linewidth}
		\centering
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/drag_coef}
			\caption{Drag coefficient}

			\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/a_prep}
			\caption{Cross sectional area}
			\label{fig:cub}
		\end{figure}
	\end{minipage}
\end{table}
Therefore, the control parameter is the cross section area $A_{\perp}$. The maximum and minimum value of $A_{\perp}$ is represented in \figref{fig:cub}. Thus, the minimum value is the surface of a square of 10cm of dimension ($A_{\perp} = 100cm^2$) and the maximum value is equal to $ \sqrt{3} \ 100cm^2$.
Thus, the drag force can be expressed as the following. 
\begin{flalign}
	\vec{F_D} = -u ||\vec{v}|| \vec{v}
	\label{eq:teor}
\end{flalign}
where $u$ is the control input and $u \in [7.27 * 10^{-16}, 1.2592*10^{-15}]$.
\section{Disturbance Models}
\subsection{Solar radiation}
Solar radiation is emitted constantly by the Sun, which illuminates the surface of the CubeSat. The surface of the satellite will absorb or reflect the solar radiation and will affect the CubeSat and produce a radiation force. \cite{SADC}

The solar flux can be computed as follows \cite{SADC}:
\begin{flalign}
	P = \dfrac{F_s}{c}
	\label{eq:flux}
\end{flalign}
where $F_s$ is the mean energy flux and it is equal with 1358 $W/m^2$ and $c$ is the speed of light

The solar radiation $\vec F_{rad}$ can be expressed as \cite{SADC}:
\begin{flalign}
\vec {F_{rad}} = C_{a} P A \ \frac{\vec {r_{sun,sat}}}{||\vec {r_{sun,sat}}||}
\label{eq:Pres}
\end{flalign}
where $C_{a}$ is the surfaceâ€™s reflectance: 0 for a perfect absorber, 2 for a perfect reflector, $P$ is the solar flux, $A$ is the radiated area, $\vec{r_{sun,sat}}$ is the vector from the sun to the satellite.

\subsection{$J_2$ gravity perturbation}
The force which the Earth is exerting upon an object is a conservative force and its potential energy can be written as follows \cite{SADC}:
\begin{flalign}
	U(r) = -\frac{\mu}{r}
	\label{eq:Pr}
\end{flalign}
Because the Earth is not a perfect sphere and also its mass distribution is not homogeneous, \eqref{eq:Pr} is rewritten as follows \cite{SADC}:
\begin{flalign}
		U(r) = -\frac{\mu}{r}+ B(r, \phi , \lambda)
	\label{eq:Pr1}
\end{flalign}
where $B(r, \phi, \lambda)$ is the spherical harmonic expansion used to correct the gravitational potential due to Earth's nonsymmetric mass distribution seen in \figref{fig:j2}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/j2}
	\caption{Coordinates for deriving the external gravitational potential of the Earth \cite{SADC}}
	\label{fig:j2}
\end{figure} 
The expression for gravitational potential of the Earth can be approximate as \cite{SADC}:
\begin{flalign}
   U \approx -\frac{\mu}{r} \left[1 - \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \left(\frac{R_e}{r}\right)^{n} J_n P_n sin(\phi)  \right ] = \frac{\mu}{r} [U_0 + U_{J_2} + U_{J_3} + ...]
	\label{eq:Pr341}
\end{flalign}
where $U_0$ = -1, $U_{J_2}$ = $\left(\frac{R_e}{r}\right)^{2} J_2 \frac{1}{2} (3 sin^2 \phi -1) $ and the other terms are neglected

The gravitational forces acting on the satellite are obtained from the relation:
\begin{flalign}
	\vec F = -m \nabla U
	\label{eq:Pr3431}
\end{flalign}
and is obtaining the following \cite{SIDI}:
\begin{flalign}
	F_x = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} = \mu \left[ -\frac{x}{r^3} + A_{J_2} \left(15 \frac{xz^2}{r^7} - 3\frac{x}{r^5}   \right ) \right ]       \\
		F_y = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial y} = \mu \left[ -\frac{y}{r^3} + A_{J_2} \left(15 \frac{yz^2}{r^7} - 3\frac{y}{r^5}   \right ) \right ]       \\
			F_z = - \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} =  \mu \left[ -\frac{z}{r^3} + A_{J_2} \left(15 \frac{z^3}{r^7} - 3\frac{z}{r^5}   \right )  \right]       
	\label{eq:Pr34331}
\end{flalign}
where $A_{J_2}  = \frac{1}{2} J_2 R_e^2$ and and $R_e$ is the mean radius o the Earth at the equator
	
%\section{State Space Representation}
%The state of the system is the vector position and the vector velocity in the inertial frame:
%\begin{flalign}
%{x} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \vec{p} \\ \vec{v} \end{array} \right]
%	\label{eq:Pr3341}
%\end{flalign}
%The equation is given by:
%\begin{flalign}
%\dot{x} &= \left[ \begin{array}{c} \vec {\dot{p}} \\ \vec {\dot{v}} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} {v} \\ {a} \end{array} \right] \\
% &= \left[ \begin{array}{c} \vec{v} \\ \frac{1}{m_{sat}}(-G\frac{m_{earth}  m_{sat}}{||\vec{p}||^3} {p} - u ||\vec{v}|| \vec{v}) + {\delta(x,t)} \end{array} \right] \\
% &= {f(x)} + u \cdot {g(x)} + {\delta(x,t)}
%\end{flalign}
%with 
%\[

%\]
%and ${\delta(x,t)}$ reprensent the influence all the disturbances.
\section{Relative dynamics} 
%ref:jesper randevouz article
In order to analyse the distance between two satellites, the relative dynamics are analyzed. Furthermore, to simplify the system, satellites will be assumed to stay on the same plane. This assumption has also to be made due to the limitation of the direction of the input control (the drag force). \\
To compute the equations of motion of one satellite compared to another, a new frame is used. The frame is illustrated in \figref{fig:rel_dyn}, where the origin is the first satellite and the axis ${\vec{\hat{x}}}$ is defined by ${\vec{\hat{x}}} = \frac{\vec R}{|| \vec R ||}$, where ${\vec R}$ is the vector from the centre of the Earth to the first satellite. The axis ${\vec{\hat{y}}}$ is perpendicular to ${\vec{\hat{x}}}$ and in the plane of motion of the satellites and ${\vec{\hat{z}}}$ is defined by the right-hand law (${\vec{\hat{z}}} = {\vec{\hat{x}}} \times {\vec{\hat{y}}}$). 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/relativeDynamics}
	\caption{Frame for the relative dynamics \cite{SFF}}
	\label{fig:rel_dyn}
\end{figure} 
Therefore, the vector position from the Earth to the first satellite and the second satellite can be expressed in this frame:
\begin{flalign}
\vec{p_1} &= R \  \vec {\hat{x}} \\
\vec{p_2} &= R \  \vec{\hat{x}} + x \ \vec {\hat{x}} + y \  \vec{\hat{y}} 
\end{flalign}
The relative equation of motion can be writen as follows:
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
& \ddot{x} - 2\dot{y}w - (y + y^{\ast})\dot{w} - (x + x^{*})w^2 = \\
&-(x + x^{*})\frac{\mu}{R^3} + \frac{u_1}{m} ||{\vec{\dot p_{1}}}|| \dot{R} - \frac{u_2}{m} ||{\vec{\dot p_{2}}}||(\dot{R} + \dot{x} - (y + y^{*})w) + \frac{\Delta F_{dist,x}}{m}\\
&\ddot{y} + 2\dot{x}w + (x + x^{*})\dot{w} - (y + y^{*})w^2 =\\
& -(y + y^{*})\frac{\mu}{R^3} + \frac{u_1}{m}||{\vec{\dot p_{1}}}||wR - \frac{u_2}{m}||{\vec{\dot p_{2}}}||(wR + (x + x^{*})w + \dot{y}) + \frac{\Delta F_{dist,y}}{m}
\end{aligned}
\right.
\label{eq:la21}
\end{equation}
The derivation of these equations can be found in \appref{chap:B}.
\subsubsection{Relative state space representation}
Since the equations of relative motion that have been derived in \appref{chap:B} are not linear, a linearization is made around the operating point, $x^{*}$ and $y^{*}$, by introducing the states with a new variable as $\vec s = [x \ \dot{x} \ y \ \dot{y}]^\mathsf{T}$. From \eqref{eq:la21} and assuming that the radius is constant and the angular velocity equals to $w = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{R^3}}$, a linearization of the system can be derived using some approximations. 
Moreover, the norm of the velocity of both satellite is assumed to be equal and constant as $||{\vec{\dot p_{1}}}|| = ||{\vec{\dot p_{2}}}|| = C$, where $C=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{R}}=\omega \ R$. Therefore, the nominal system is given by:
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
& {\dot s_{1}} = s_2 \\
& {\dot s_{2}} = 2ws_4 - u_2\frac{y^{*}wC}{m} \\
& {\dot s_{3}} = s_4 \\
& {\dot s_{4}} = -2ws_2 - \Big(u_2 - u_1 \Big) \frac{wRC}{m}
\label{eq:statespaceassumption}  
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}
using the approximation $\dot{x}$, $y \ll y^{*}$ and $x, x^{*}$, $\frac{\dot{y}}{w} \ll R$, therefore the system in state space can be writen as:
 \begin{flalign*}
 	{\vec {\dot{s}}(t)} ={\underline A \vec s(t) + \vec Bu(t)} 
 \end{flalign*}  
\begin{flalign*}
	{\underline A}
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		0& 1& 0 & 0 \\
		0& 0&0&2w  \\ 
		0&0&0&1 \\
		0&-2w & 0 &0
	\end{bmatrix} 
\end{flalign*}
\begin{flalign*}
	{\vec B}
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		0& \\
		0&  \\ 
		0& \\
		-R^2 \ w^2&
	\end{bmatrix} 
\end{flalign*}
where $u= u_2 - u_1$.
With these assumptions and where $u_2$ and $u_1$ are chosen to be equal to $u_{max}$ and $u_{min}$ respectively, therefore, $u>0$ and in this case, $y$ should decrease as seen in \figref{fig:u1}. From \figref{fig:u2}, it can be seen that the approximation and real model of $y$  are not the similar. This is due to the fact that when a satellite is subjected to a drag force, the altitude of the satellite is decreasing and the angular velocity is increasing, which will be proved in the next section.
\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\linewidth}
		\centering
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/pic2.eps}
			\caption{Approximation model}
			\label{fig:u1}
		\end{figure}
	\end{minipage}\hfill
	\begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\linewidth}
		\centering
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/pic1.eps}
			\caption{Real model}
			\label{fig:u2}
		\end{figure}
	\end{minipage}
\end{table}
Therefore, when $u_2 > u_1$, then $w_2 > w_1$ this will lead to an increase in the angle $\theta$ between the satellites, and since $y = R \ sin\theta$, $y$ will have an increasing attitude. The above mentioned issues are shown in \figref{fig:u2}.

In conclusion, the approximation that the time derivative of angular velocity is equal to 0 cannot be made for controlling the distance between the two satellites.
\section{Modelling based on the angular velocity}
As seen in the previous section, the angular velocity cannot be assumed constant. Therefore, an equation is needed to estimate it as a function of the drag force. In \appref{chap:C}, the time derivative of the norm of the angular velocity can be approximated as a linear function of the drag force. 
\begin{flalign}
	{\Delta \dot\omega} = C  u
	\label{eq:u3}
\end{flalign}
with $C = \frac{3 \omega_0^2  R_0}{m}$. In order to check this equation and the coefficient $C$, a simulation is performed using a constant drag force coefficient ($ u = u_{min}$). The angular velocity as a function of time is shown in \figref{fig:testCoef}. 
	\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/test_coef.eps}
	\caption{Angular velocity as function of time}
	\label{fig:testCoef}
	\end{figure}
	\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/test_coef_oscillations.eps}
	\caption{Zoom in on the oscillation of the angular velocity}
	\label{fig:u23}
	\end{figure}
The coefficient found in the simulation is almost the same than in the theory. Oscillations can be observed in \figref{fig:u23} with a frequency equals to $f \approx \frac{2\pi}{\omega_0}$, where $\omega_0$ is the angular velocity of the satellite in the beginning. This is due to the fact that the orbit is not exactly a circle but an ellipse. Thus, the angular velocity changes slightly during a turn around the Earth. In order to limit the influence of these variations on the controller, a second order low pass filter is added to reduce the amplitude of these oscillations. A state space representation can be derived with states $\theta$ and $\dot \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between two satellites. The time derivative of $\dot \theta$ is equal with ${\dot \omega_2} -  {\dot \omega_1}$ and using \eqref{eq:u3}, $\ddot \theta = C   u_2 -  C u_1 = C  u$.
\begin{flalign}
	{\vec s}
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\theta  \\
		\dot{\theta}
	\end{bmatrix} 
\end{flalign}
\begin{flalign}
	{\vec {\dot s} (t)} ={\underline A s(t) + \vec B u(t)}  
		\label{eq:lt}
\end{flalign}  
where
\begin{flalign}
	{\underline A}
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		0& 1& \\
		0& 0&
	\end{bmatrix} 
\end{flalign}
\begin{flalign}
	{\vec B}
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		0& \\
		\frac{3 \omega_0^2 R_0}{m}
	\end{bmatrix} 
\end{flalign}
\section{Distance control design}
A controller is designed to control the angle between two satellites. Due to the fact that the state representation is linear, Linear Quadratic Regulator(LQR) is chosen as control method with the following cost function:
\begin{flalign}
\mathcal{I} =  \int (\vec{x}^\mathsf{T} \ \underline{Q} \ \vec{x} + \vec{u}^\mathsf{T} \ \underline{R}  \ \vec{u}) dt
\end{flalign}
Due to the fact that no predefined cost is specified, the weighting matrices can be chosen as maximum acceptable values \cite{LQR}, thus, the $\underline R$ matrix is defined as $\underline R = [u_{delta}^{-2}]$ ($u_{delta} = u_{max} - u_{min}$). For the states weighting matrices, no maximum value is defined. The weight of the second state is chosen to be equal to zero because the desired state to converge is $\theta$ and if the first state converges, the second state will also converge to zero. The weight for the first state ($\theta$), is chosen by trial and error leading to the trade off between fast saturation and slow controller since for big values of weights the controller will be in saturation mode faster and with low values, the convergence will be slower. Therefore, the weighting matrices are given by \label{ref}:
\begin{flalign}
	{\underline{Q}}
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		(\frac{\pi}{7})^{-2}& 0& \\
		0& 0&
	\end{bmatrix} 
\end{flalign}
\begin{flalign}
	{\underline{R}}
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		u_{delta}^{-2}
	\end{bmatrix} 
\end{flalign}
 The vector of gains K is obtained by solving the Algebraic Riccati equation. The control input signal can be computed ($u = u_2 - u_1$) and therefore if $u$ is bigger than zero, $u_1$ will be equal to $u_{min}$ and $u_2$ will be equal to $u + u_{min}$. If $u$ is smaller than zero, it will be the opposite. The control law used for designing the controller is $u = -K(1) \ \theta \ -K(2) \ \dot \theta $. \label{eq:ctr}
 
 \subsection{Frequency Analysis}
The loop transfer function can be computed $L(s) = P(s) \ C(s) \ LPF(s) \ H_{attittude}(s)$ where $P(s)$ is the transfer function of the state representation system, $C(s) = K_1 + K_2 s$ is the transfer function of the controller, $LPF(s)$ is the transfer function of the second order low pass filter and $H_{attitude}$ is a first order transfer function where the rise time is chosen to be equal to 10 minutes which is an estimation of time that the satellite takes to converge into the good orientation.
The bode diagram of L(s) is represented in the \figref{fig:Bode_L}. \\
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]
	{figures/Bode_L.eps}
	\caption{Bode diagram of the loop transfer function}
	\label{fig:Bode_L}
\end{figure}
The crossover frequency and the phase margin can be extracted from the bode diagram. The crossover frequency is equal to $2.6418*10^{-7}\frac{rad}{s}$ and the phase margin is equal to $62.7074^{\circ}$ which is enough to accept a large delay due to the small crossover frequency. 
 
\subsection{Satellite Formation Control} 
\subsubsection{Global algorithm}
Since the formation consists of more than two satellites, a second controller is designed to control n satellites around the Earth. The gain vector K computed above can be used to calculate the difference drag force between two neighbours satellites (called $u_a = u_2 - u_1$, $u_b = u_3 - u_2$, ...). Thus, a system of $n-1$ equations with n unknown variables is obtained. the last equation is chosen to set the minimum value of $u_1$, $u_2$,... equals to $u_{min}$. We have now a system of $n$ equations with $n$ unknown variables that can be solved to determine the drag force coefficient $u_i$ for each satellite. Therefore, to compute the drag force applied on one satellite, the controller needs to know the states of all the other satellites.
\subsubsection{Distributed algorithm}
In this case, $u_1$ is chosen to be equal with $u_{medium}$, therefore $u_2$ is computed using the control law found in \eqref{eq:ctr}, which is a function of the angle between the first satellite and the second one. The drag force of satellite $i$ can be determined by knowing the angle between the satellite $i$ and $i-1$, the time derivative of this angle and the drag force of the satellite $i-1$.
\subsection{Stability Analysis}
In order to analyze the stability of the distributed formation controller, the global system is written in state space form as in  \eqref{eq:lt}. The states are defined as 
\begin{flalign*}
	\vec s = [\vec \theta_n \ \dot{\vec \theta_n}]^\mathsf{T}
	\label{stateformation}
\end{flalign*}
where $\vec \theta_n = [\theta_{12} \ \theta_{23} \ \theta_{34} \ \theta_{45} \ \theta_{56} \ \theta_{67} \ \theta_{78}]^\mathsf{T}$ are the angles between neighbour satellites and $\dot{\theta_n} $ is the time derivative of these angles. The system matrix will be a 14x14 matrix and for $i<8$ satellites, $\dot{s}_{i} = s_{i+7}$. Therefore the $\underline A$ and $\underline B$ matrix can be written as:

	\begin{flalign}
	\underline A = \left(\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c}
    \underline0_{(7\times7)} & | & \underline I_{(7\times7)}\\
	\hline
	  & \underline0_{(7\times14)}
	\end{array}\right)
\end{flalign}
\begin{flalign}
	\underline B = \left(\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c}
	& \underline 0_{(7\times7)} \\
	\hline
	& C \ \underline I_{(7\times7)}
	\end{array}\right)
\end{flalign}
	
with the constant $C = \frac{3 \omega_0^2 R_0}{m} $ and $\vec u = [u_2-u_1;u_3-u_2;...;u_8-u_7]$.

The controller gain that has been found in section \ref{ref}, $\vec K = [K_{1} \ K_{2}]$, now can be written as $\underline K_{s} = [K_{1}\underline I_{(7\times7)},  \ K_{2}\underline I_{(7\times7)}]$ and  by using a control law $u = -\underline K \vec s$ a stability analysis can be made using a Lyapunov candidate function $V = \vec s^{T}\vec s$ where $V>0$, $\forall \vec s\neq \vec  0 $. Inserting $\underline K_{s}$, the state space equation becomes:
\begin{flalign}
	&{ \dot{ \vec {s}}} ={(\underline A  + \underline B\underline K_{s})\vec s}
	\label{eq:statespacecomplex2}
\end{flalign}  
%
From Lyapunov stability criterion, it has to be shown that $\dot{V} <0$,$\forall s\neq0 $. The derivative of the candidate function can be written as 
%
\begin{flalign}
	&{\dot{V}} ={\dot{\vec s}^\mathsf{T}\vec s+\vec s^\mathsf{T}{ \dot{ \vec {s}}}}
	\label{eq:statespacecomplex3}
\end{flalign}
%
and this is equal to:
%
\begin{flalign}
	&{\dot{V}} ={\vec s^\mathsf{T}(\underline A-\underline B \underline K)^\mathsf{T}\vec s + \vec s^\mathsf{T}(\underline A-\underline B\underline K)\vec s}
	\label{eq:statespacecomplex4}
\end{flalign}
so the only thing that has to be shown in order the system to be stable is to show that the all the eigenvalues of $\underline A-\underline B\underline K<0$. The eigenvalues $\underline A- \underline B\underline K$ were computed and the result was that all eigenvalues have negative real part. \\
N.B: the drag forces are assumed to not be in saturation.
\section{Simulation and results}
 First, the simulation results of the control scheme between two satellites are shown. The reference angle is chosen to be $45^{o}$ for the whole formation. The inputs to the controller are $\Delta\theta$ and $\dot{\theta}$, where $\Delta\theta = \theta - \theta_{ref}$ and $\dot{\theta} = w_2 - w_1$. In order to smooth the high frequency  oscillations from $\theta$, $w_1$ and $w_2$ to the controller a low pass filter is used. The control design is similar to PD controller. In \figref{fig:distancecontrol} is shown the response of the controller and in \figref{fig:distancecontrol2} the angle between two satellites. The settling time is $2\times10^7$ which is equivalent to 230 days which is satisfactory, and also no saturation in the drag force appears.

\subsection{Global algorithm results}
The behaviour of the satellite formation using global algorithm was tested according to a hypothesis that the satellite formation starts at the same place. From \figref{fig:forr} it can be seen that in the beginning, some saturation appears, but finally, all the satellites converged to the desired angle of 45$^{\circ}$ .

\end{figure}
\subsection{Distributed algorithm results}
In the case of a distributed algorithm, the behaviour of the satellite formation is shown in \figref{fig:da1}, where it can be seen that the overshoot is big, therefore in order to reduce the overshoot, the derivative gain is increased by a factor of 2, which will correct the overshoot as seen in  \figref{fig:da1}.
\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\linewidth}

		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=1.1\linewidth]{figures/da1.eps}

			\label{fig:da2}
		\end{figure}
	\end{minipage}
\end{table}
The drawback of distributed algorithm is that the angle between satellites will converge slower compared with the global algorithm, moreover, all the satellites are converging to $u_{min}$, while in the case of distributed algorithm are converging to $u_{medium}$. 

The difference between distributed and global algorithm comes from the fact that the drag force of one satellite is set to constant in the case of distributed algorithm, which leads to less maneuverability, therefore more saturation.
