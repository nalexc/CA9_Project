\section{Problem statement}
%
Design and implement a controller for attitude and position of several pico-satellites in orbit.

\section{Use-case}\label{sec:useCase}
%
Denmark has a small island called Greenland, where the Danish Government needs to monitor it.
One method is to have a constellation of six satellites going around the orbit. The idea is that whenever the satellites are located in the northern hemisphere, both of them will point down and look towards Greenland. The surveillance might contain taking pictures and measurements. After the surveillance, the concept is to change the attitude and having a control of the distance between them as they are in orbit.

The task the satellite has to perform is acquiring data by flying around Greenland.

This gives two main objectives for the satellite:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Studying the orbital dynamic model by looking at one satellite neighbours 
	\item Attitude and orbit determination using momentum wheels.
\end{itemize}
