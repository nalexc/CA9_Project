\section{Problem statement}
%Design and implement a controller for attitude and position of several pico-satellites in orbit.
Design and implement a controller for controlling the individual distance between satellites using the drag force.
\section{Use-case}\label{sec:useCase}
In this project the concept of a formation flight of satellites will be used for the purpose of monitoring. Denmark has a small island called Greenland, where the Danish Government needs to monitor it. One method is to have a formation of satellites going around the orbit and when they are located in the northern hemisphere, the satellites will point down and look towards Greenland. 

One of the essentials in formation flight is choosing the number of satellites in orbit. Therefore, in order to have a continuous coverage, a distributed satellite system composed of six satellites equally distributed are chosen, compared with two or four satellites where communication between each other will be poor.
% After the surveillance, the concept is to change the attitude and having a control of the distance between them as they are in orbit.

The task the satellite has to perform is acquiring data by flying around Greenland, using radio signals and taking pictures.
%This gives two main objectives for the satellite:

%\begin{itemize}
%	\item In formation flight one of the main challenges is to find and detect the position 
%	\item Acquiring data by flying around Greenland, using radio signals and taking pictures
%	\item Studying the orbital dynamic model by looking at one satellite neighbours 
%	\item Attitude and orbit determination using momentum wheels.
