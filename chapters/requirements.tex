\chapter{Requirements}\label{chap:requirements}
Based on the use-case introduced and the available system a set of requirements are formulated.
%
\subsection*{System requirements}
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{The formation shall be able to maintain a given angle within 45$^{\circ}$}
	The system of satellites shall be able to create a formation around the earth where the a angle between them will be equal   
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item []Measure the position of the satellites and using the drag force to control the velocity 
%	\end{itemize}
%	\item \textbf{The satellite should be able to turn twords target}
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item[] Measure the current attitude of the satellites and to control it in order to achieve the specify orientation
%	\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Each satellite shall be able to change its orientation}
	The satellites shall be able to rotating using momentum wheels to point towards the desired direction in order to apply the expected drag force  	
\end{enumerate}
